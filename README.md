# MotionPack
A datapack that can apply motion to players

How to use:

Set the motionx, motiony and motionz scores for a player, then run the "motion:applymotion" function as and at that player.
To launch yourself in the direction you're facing, use the "motion:launchforward" function.



-Positive x and z values will launch you in the positive x and z direction, negative values do the opposite.
-The amount of slimes that spawn depends on the x and z values, so don't set those too high, unless you want your game to crash.
-Y values below 0 and above 135 don't work.
-Vertical motion is pretty inconsistent, sometimes it will launch you higher for some reason.
